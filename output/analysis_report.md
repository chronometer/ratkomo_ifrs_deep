Generated on: 2025-02-23 01:23:13

## Executive Summary
Based on the analysis of the provided document segments, the following key points were identified:

## Key Findings
- Overall Compliance Status:
- 1. Revenue Recognition (IFRS 15):
- Key Compliance Findings:
- The report provides a breakdown of revenue by customer segment (Private, Corporate, Public). This is a good starting point for IFRS 15 analysis.
- The report mentions a 10% increase in revenue, which is a relevant figure.
- Specific Standard References:
- IFRS 15.31-37 (Disaggregation of revenue): The breakdown of revenue by customer type partially addresses this requirement.
- IFRS 15.113-129 (Disclosure requirements):  More detailed disclosures are needed to fully assess compliance.
- Recommendations for Improvement:
- Detailed Revenue Recognition Policies:** The report *must* include a clear and comprehensive description of Pihlajalinna's revenue recognition policies. This should cover:
- How the five-step model of IFRS 15 is applied to each significant revenue stream (e.g., medical services, occupational healthcare, etc.).
- Identification of performance obligations.
- Determination of the transaction price.
- Allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.
- Recognition of revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.
- Contract Balances:** Disclose contract assets and liabilities (deferred revenue) arising from contracts with customers (IFRS 15.113(a)).  Explain the significant changes in these balances during the year.
- Significant Judgments:** Disclose significant judgments made in applying IFRS 15, such as determining whether the company is acting as a principal or an agent (IFRS 15.123).
- Nature, Amount, Timing and Uncertainty of Revenue:** Disclose information about these factors (IFRS 15.114). For example, are there seasonal variations in revenue? Are there significant uncertainties related to collectability?
- Consideration Payable to Customers:** If applicable, disclose information about consideration payable to customers (IFRS 15.126-128).
- Compliance Status:**  Potentially non-compliant without further detailed disclosures on revenue recognition policies and related information.
- 2. Financial Instruments (IFRS 9):
- Key Compliance Findings:
- The report mentions cash balances and net debt, which are relevant to IFRS 9.
- The issuance of a hybrid bond is a significant event that requires IFRS 9 treatment.
- Specific Standard References:
- IFRS 9.4.1 (Classification and measurement of financial assets): How are cash, receivables, and other financial assets classified and measured?
- IFRS 9.4.2 (Classification and measurement of financial liabilities): How is the hybrid bond classified (equity or liability component) and measured?
- IFRS 9.5.5 (Impairment): How is the impairment of financial assets (e.g., trade receivables) assessed?
- IFRS 7 (Disclosure): While not IFRS 9 itself, IFRS 7 provides the disclosure requirements related to financial instruments.
- Recommendations for Improvement:
- Classification and Measurement:**  Clearly state the classification and measurement policies for all financial assets and liabilities. Justify the classification of the hybrid bond (liability or equity).
- Impairment:** Disclose the methodology used to assess impairment of financial assets, including assumptions and inputs.  Provide a reconciliation of the loss allowance.
- Risk Management:** Disclose information about the company's exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk (IFRS 7).
- Fair Value Disclosures:** If any financial instruments are measured at fair value, provide the required fair value hierarchy disclosures (IFRS 13, referenced by IFRS 7).
- Compliance Status:**  Potentially non-compliant without detailed disclosures on financial instrument classification, measurement, impairment, and risk management. The hybrid bond issuance requires careful accounting treatment and disclosure.
- 3. Leasing Arrangements (IFRS 16):
- Key Compliance Findings:
- The report doesn't explicitly mention leases. However, it's highly likely that Pihlajalinna has lease arrangements for properties (medical centers, offices) and equipment.
- Specific Standard References:
- IFRS 16.22 (Recognition exemption for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets): If applicable, disclose the use of these exemptions.
- IFRS 16.47 (Lease liabilities): Disclose the lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet.
- IFRS 16.53 (Right-of-use assets): Disclose the right-of-use (ROU) assets recognized on the balance sheet.
- IFRS 16.59 (Disclosure requirements): Extensive disclosure requirements related to leases.
- Recommendations for Improvement:
- Lease Accounting Policy:**  Disclose the company's accounting policy for leases, including how ROU assets and lease liabilities are measured.
- ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities:**  Disclose the carrying amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities separately in the balance sheet or in the notes.
- Lease Expenses:** Disclose lease expenses for the year, including depreciation of ROU assets and interest on lease liabilities.
- Maturity Analysis:**  Provide a maturity analysis of lease liabilities (IFRS 16.59(a)).
- Sale and Leaseback Transactions:** If any sale and leaseback transactions occurred, disclose the details and accounting treatment.
- Compliance Status:**  Likely non-compliant if there are leases and no disclosures are made.  IFRS 16 has a significant impact on the balance sheet and income statement.
- 4. Segment Reporting (IFRS 8):
- Key Compliance Findings:
- The report provides a breakdown of revenue by customer type, which *could* be used as a basis for segment reporting. However, this is not necessarily the same as operating segments under IFRS 8.
- Specific Standard References:
- IFRS 8.5 (Definition of operating segments): Operating segments are components of an entity that meet specific criteria.
- IFRS 8.12 (Reportable segments):  How are reportable segments determined?
- IFRS 8.22-34 (Disclosure requirements): Extensive disclosure requirements for reportable segments.
- Recommendations for Improvement:
- Identify Operating Segments:** Determine whether the company has operating segments that meet the definition in IFRS 8.  Consider the organizational structure and how management makes decisions.
- Reportable Segments:** Determine which operating segments are reportable based on the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8.13.
- Segment Disclosures:**  Provide the required disclosures for each reportable segment, including:
- Revenue from external customers.
- Segment profit or loss.
- Segment assets.
- Segment liabilities (if regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker).
- Reconciliation of segment amounts to the consolidated financial statements.
- Entity-Wide Disclosures:** If segment information is not provided, provide the entity-wide disclosures required by IFRS 8.35-36 (e.g., revenue from major customers).
- Compliance Status:**  Potentially non-compliant. The revenue breakdown by customer type is insufficient to satisfy IFRS 8 requirements if the company has reportable operating segments.
- Additional Considerations:
- Going Concern:** The report should include an assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern (IAS 1).
- Related Party Disclosures:** Disclosures about related party transactions are required (IAS 24).
- Events After the Reporting Period:** Any material events occurring after December 31, 2023, should be disclosed (IAS 10).
- Statement of Compliance:** The report should explicitly state that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
- In conclusion:
